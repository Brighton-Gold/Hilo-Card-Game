# Hilo-Card-Game 



# The Hilo card game is a simple guessing game where the player must guess if the next card the dealer draws will be higher or lower. 
# Each player starts with 300 points at the start of the game and if Guess correctly they can earn points but if they aren't right, they will lose points. 
# If they lose all of them, then the game is over. This game will also be like that. For this digital version of the game each card will simply be 
# presented as a number from 1 to 13. User can then enter either an H or an L if they think the next card will be higher or lower, and if they run out of points
# the game will either end or restart depending on what the user wants to do.
